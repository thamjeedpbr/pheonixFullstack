## 🎨 Design Pattern Implemented

### Card-Based UI
Every level uses beautiful, hover-animated cards:

**Order → Sections (Cards)**
```
[Section 1]  [Section 2]  [Section 3]
  3 Forms      2 Forms      5 Forms
```

**Section → Forms (Cards)**
```
[Form 1]     [Form 2]     [Form 3]
Status       Status       Status
Machine      Machine      Machine
Operators    Operators    Operators
```

### Key Features:
- ✅ Gradient headers
- ✅ Status badges with colors
- ✅ Icon representations
- ✅ Hover animations (shadow + border + arrow)
- ✅ Click to drill down
- ✅ Responsive 3-column grid (1 col mobile, 2 tablet, 3 desktop)

## 🔗 The Complete Flow

```
1. CREATE ORDER
   ↓
2. VIEW ORDER
   ↓ Click "Add Section"
3. CREATE SECTION (inline modal)
   ↓
4. SECTION CARD APPEARS
   ↓ Click "View Forms"
5. VIEW SECTION PAGE
   ↓ Click "Add Form"
6. REDIRECT TO FORM CREATE (section_id pre-filled)
   ↓
7. CREATE FORM
   ↓
8. FORM CARD APPEARS IN SECTION
   ↓ Click Form Card
9. VIEW FORM DETAILS
```

## 🔒 Data Protection

### Cannot Create Orphans:
- ❌ Cannot create Section without Order
- ❌ Cannot create Form without Section

### Cannot Delete with Children:
- ❌ Cannot delete Order if it has Sections
- ❌ Cannot delete Section if it has Forms

### Must Delete Bottom-Up:
```
Delete Forms first
  ↓
Then delete Section
  ↓
Then delete Order
```
