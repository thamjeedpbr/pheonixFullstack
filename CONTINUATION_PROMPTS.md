   - store() - Create new user with validation
   - show() - Get single user with relationships
   - update() - Update user
   - destroy() - Delete user (soft delete)
   - Use ApiResponseTrait for all responses

   - Same fields as Create (password optional)
   - "Change Password" checkbox to show password fields
   - Update user via PUT /api/users/{id}
   - Success: redirect to users list

4. resources/js/Components/DataTable.vue (reusable)
   - Props: columns, data, loading

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- Use ApiResponseTrait in controller
- Use DB transactions for all write operations
- Check permissions with check.permission middleware
- Eager load relationships to avoid N+1 queries
- Use UserResource for API responses
- Test with user: admin/password
- Follow same patterns as AuthController

Start with backend files first, then frontend. Test each component before moving to next.
