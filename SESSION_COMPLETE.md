## 🚀 WHAT'S NEXT

### Immediate Priority: Testing (RECOMMENDED)

**Take 1-2 hours to test the Form Management module before continuing**:
1. Start servers (`php artisan serve` & `npm run dev`)
2. Login (admin/password)
3. Create a form
4. Test production workflow
5. Verify all features work

**Why test now?**
- Form Management is the foundation for everything else
- Catch issues early
- Gain confidence in the system
- See your work in action!

### Then: Module 13 - Production Operations

**What to build next**:
1. FormButtonActionController - Record button clicks
2. DmiDataController - Production data entry
3. LoginDetailController - Operator tracking
4. Integration with Forms/Show.vue
5. DMI data entry component

**Estimated Time**: 12 hours (~1.5 days)

## 🎯 RECOMMENDED NEXT STEPS

### Option 1: Test & Verify (RECOMMENDED) ⭐
**Time**: 1-2 hours  
**Value**: High confidence, catch issues early

1. Test Form Management thoroughly
2. Verify all workflows
3. Check mobile responsiveness
4. Confirm no console errors

### Option 2: Continue Building
**Time**: 4+ hours  
**Value**: Maintain momentum

1. Jump into Module 13

## 📞 NEED HELP?

If you encounter any issues:

**Check Documentation**:
- FORM_MANAGEMENT_COMPLETE.md
- WHATS_NEXT.md
- PROGRESS_TRACKER.md

**Debug Tips**:
- Check Laravel logs: `storage/logs/laravel.log`
- Check browser console for errors
- Verify API endpoints with Postman
- Test mobile view (< 768px width)

**Common Issues**:
- Forms list empty → Normal, create a form first
- Cannot delete form → Only pending forms can be deleted
- Button not working → Check status and state machine
- Status not changing → Check console and validate transitions
