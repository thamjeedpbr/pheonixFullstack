- Track 8 different production statuses
- Foundation for production operations
- Most complex relationships

### Backend Components Needed:
- [ ] **FormController** - Complex CRUD (15+ methods)
  - [ ] index() - List forms with advanced filters
  - [ ] store() - Create production form
  - [ ] show() - View form with all relationships
  - [ ] update() - Update form details
  - [ ] destroy() - Delete form
  - [ ] assignMachine() - Assign machine to form
  - [ ] assignOperators() - Assign multiple operators
  - [ ] assignMaterials() - Assign multiple materials
  - [ ] getFormStats() - Form statistics
  - [ ] getAvailableForms() - Forms ready for production
  - [ ] changeStatus() - Update form status
