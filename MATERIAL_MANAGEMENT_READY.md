## Pattern Established ✅

The Material Management module successfully proves our standardized pattern works perfectly:

### Backend Pattern
```php
Controller (7 methods) → 
Request (validation) → 
Resource (transformation) → 
Routes (RESTful)
```

### Frontend Pattern
```vue
Index Page (responsive) →
  - Mobile: Floating filters + Cards + Infinite scroll
  - Desktop: Filter row + Table + Pagination
Form Modal (create + edit) →
Sidebar & Router updates
```
