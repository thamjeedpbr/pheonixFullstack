## Copy & Paste This to Start Building Production Core

---

```
I'm continuing the Phoenix Manufacturing System development. 

Project: /Users/thamjeedlal/Herd/pheonixFullstack/

CURRENT STATUS:
âœ… All 10 Master Modules Complete (Authentication, Users, Machines, Materials, etc.)
âœ… Database: 36 tables with 162+ relationships
âœ… Backend: 40+ files, 50+ API endpoints working
âœ… Frontend: 35+ responsive pages with mobile-first design
âœ… Progress: 65% complete

NEXT PHASE: Production Core Modules

I want to start with MODULE 11: ORDER MANAGEMENT (Job Cards)

Please read these files first:
- PROGRESS_TRACKER.md (shows current status)
- NEXT_PHASE_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md (complete guide for remaining work)

Then create the Order Management module:

BACKEND TO CREATE:
1. app/Http/Controllers/OrderController.php
   - index() - List orders with filters & pagination
   - store() - Create new order (job card)
   - show() - View order with sections
   - update() - Update order
   - destroy() - Delete order
   - stats() - Order statistics
   - changeStatus() - Update order status
   - byStatus() - Filter by status

2. app/Http/Requests/OrderRequest.php
   - Validation for job_card_no, client_name, title, delivery_date
   - Custom error messages
   - Unique job card number validation

3. app/Http/Resources/OrderResource.php
   - Transform order data
   - Include sections with forms count
   - Include created_by user info

4. routes/api.php
   - Add 8 order endpoints with proper permissions
   - Use order_view, order_create, order_update, order_delete

FRONTEND TO CREATE:
1. resources/js/Pages/Orders/Index.vue
   - Responsive design (mobile card view + desktop table view)
   - Floating filter bar (mobile, sticky below navbar)
   - Desktop filter row (search, status, priority, date)
   - Search by job card number, client name, title
   - Filter by status (pending/in_progress/completed/cancelled)
   - Filter by priority (low/normal/high/urgent)
   - Date range filter
   - Status badges with colors
   - Infinite scroll (mobile) / Pagination (desktop)
   - Quick actions (view, edit, delete)
   - Create button (floating on mobile)

2. resources/js/Pages/Orders/Create.vue
   - Job card number input (required, unique)
   - Client name input
   - Title input
   - Description textarea
   - Delivery date picker
   - Priority dropdown
   - Form validation
   - Loading states
   - Error handling
   - Success redirect to orders list

3. resources/js/Pages/Orders/Edit.vue
   - Pre-filled form from order data
   - Same fields as create
   - Update button
   - Cancel button
   - Validation

4. resources/js/Pages/Orders/Show.vue
   - Order details (job card no, client, title, delivery date)
   - Status badge
   - Priority badge
   - Created by info
   - Sections list with forms count
   - Timeline (created, status changes)
   - Edit button
   - Delete button (with confirmation)
   - Back button

5. Update Sidebar.vue
   - Add Orders menu item with ClipboardList icon
   - Check order_view permission
   - Active state highlighting

6. Update router.js
   - Add orders routes (index, create, show, edit)
   - All require auth

DESIGN REQUIREMENTS:
- Mobile-first responsive design
- Follow established patterns from other modules
- Tailwind CSS styling
- Status colors:
  * pending: gray-500
  * in_progress: blue-500
  * completed: green-500
  * cancelled: red-500
- Priority colors:
  * low: gray-400
  * normal: blue-400
  * high: orange-500
  * urgent: red-500
- Floating filter bar on mobile (h-14, sticky at top-16)
- Cards on mobile (shadow-md, rounded-lg, p-4)
- Table on desktop (sortable headers, hover effects)
- Touch-friendly buttons (44x44px minimum)
- Loading states for all actions
- Error handling with toasts/alerts
- Smooth transitions

TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS:
- Use ApiResponseTrait in controller
- DB transactions for create/update/delete
- Eager load relationships (sections, createdBy)
- Debounced search (300ms)
- Permission checks on routes
- Try-catch error handling
- HTTP status codes (200, 201, 404, 500)
- JSON responses with success/message/data structure

TEST AFTER CREATION:
Backend (use Postman):
- GET /api/orders - List with pagination
- GET /api/orders/stats - Statistics
- POST /api/orders - Create new order
- GET /api/orders/{id} - View order
- PUT /api/orders/{id} - Update order
- DELETE /api/orders/{id} - Delete order
- PATCH /api/orders/{id}/status - Change status

Frontend (browser):
- Orders list loads (desktop table, mobile cards)
- Search works with debounce
- Filters work (status, priority, date)
- Can create new order with validation
- Can edit existing order
- Can delete order (with confirmation)
- Can view order details with sections
- Responsive on mobile (test in DevTools)
- Sidebar menu works
- Navigation works
- All permissions checked

Start with backend first (controller, request, resource, routes), then test with Postman. 
After backend works, create frontend pages following the established mobile-first responsive patterns.

Build complete, production-ready code with proper error handling and validation.
```

## Alternative: If You Want to Build All Remaining Modules

```
I'm continuing the Phoenix Manufacturing System. Project location: /Users/thamjeedlal/Herd/pheonixFullstack/

Current status: All 10 master modules complete (65% overall). 

I want to build ALL remaining production core modules:
- Module 11: Order Management
- Module 12: Form/Job Management  
- Module 13: Production Operations
- Module 14: Quality Control
- Module 15: Supporting Features

Read NEXT_PHASE_PRODUCTION_GUIDE.md for complete specifications.

Start with Order Management first, then move to Form Management after I test it.

Build each module completely with:
- Backend (Controller, Request, Resource, Routes)
- Frontend (Index, Create, Edit, Show pages)
- Responsive design (mobile + desktop)
- All features from the guide

Use established patterns from completed master modules.
```

---

## What You'll Get

After Order Management is complete:
- âœ… Full job card (order) system
- âœ… Create, view, edit, delete orders
- âœ… Search and filter orders
- âœ… Link sections to orders
- âœ… Track order status
- âœ… Priority management
- âœ… Statistics dashboard
- âœ… Fully responsive UI
- âœ… Permission-based access

Then you can move to Form Management (the most critical module).
